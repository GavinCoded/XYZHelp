# The Basics
**When you load up XYZ, it should open up the loader and executor. There should be text at the side that should consist of buttons like**

- Execute
- Attach
- Clear
- Open
- Script Hub
- Settings

**These Buttons do all the basics tasks you would need in a executor!**
# Execution.
**When you load xyz, you will see a text editor and a few buttons. These can do all sorts of functions. At the top left you should see a attach button**
- First, Press "Attach" To Inject Into The Process/Roblox.
- Next, Put a script inside the text box (Or import a script from any text file / lua file)
- Finally, Press "Execute" To Export the text into roblox!
